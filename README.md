**California Fish Plants By County App**

This Flask app, created with the help of AI, lets the user search for a California county and returns a list of bodies of water that have been recently planted with fish. The list shows the most recent plant as well as the next plant, if there are any planned. The user is then able to click on the body of water they choose to show on a map where the body of water is located. If the map is unable to locate the body of water the county seat will show instead.
